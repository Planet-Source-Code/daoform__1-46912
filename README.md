## DAOform

### Description

On browsing the forum and the net, I see a lot of questions

relating to data integrity in a VB form.

It's an issue I come up against a lot myself - so here, I have attempted

to address some of the issues raised and provide a possible solution.

The form is designed around the DAO data reference.

It is an attempt to make a bullet proof data form in that . .

If the user changes the value in a field and then tries to

move to another record, or add a new record, or close the form or whatever . .

then the form will pick up the changes and ask if the user wants to save.
