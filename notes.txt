On browsing the forum and the net, I see a lot of questions
relating to data integrity in a VB form.

It's an issue I come up against a lot myself - so here, I have attempted
to address some of the issues raised and provide a possible solution.

The form is designed around the DAO data reference.
It is an attempt to make a bullet proof data form in that . . 

If the user changes the value in a field and then tries to 
move to another record, or add a new record, or close the form or whatever . . 
then the form will pick up the changes and ask if the user wants to save.

Its basically an attempt to make using DAO on forms safer for data integrity.

If anyone has any ways to improve this method, please post.

The find facility is a nice utility that I strung together from a mixture
of code from others and some of my own.

Clicking find will open a find form with a listview of all the records.
Click any header and the search bok at the top of the form becomes relevant to
the column that you clicked.
Enter a few characters in it and the listview will try to match and select 
the first record it finds that matches your text.

Click on any column header to sort by that column no matter what the data type is.
This puppy will sort strings, dates, numbers, urls, yes/no, memo, ..whatever.
Click the columnheader again to sort in the reverse order.

Keys.
[Page Down] or [Arrow Down] = Move to next record
[Page Up] or [Arrow Up] = Move to previous record

[Ctrl & [Page Down] or [Arrow Down] = Move to Last record
[Ctrl & [Page Up] or [Arrow Up] = Move to First record

[End] = Move to Last record
[Home] = Move to First record

[Escape] = Close 

[F2] = Find

Hope its useful to some
